excerpt: "In this study, a novel SI system was proposed for children
with VPI, capable of simultaneously estimating nasalance along with three source features. The results demonstrated
that the proposed SI system, initially trained on healthy adult speech and subsequently fine-tuned with VPI child speech
(SI-FT) significantly improved the estimation of nasalance. This underscores the importance of adapting models to the
unique acoustic characteristics of speech in children with VPI. Moreover, the findings highlighted the effectiveness of a
multi-task learning framework and the integration of WavLMLarge SSL representations, which collectively enhanced the
overall performance of the SI system. The ability of the SIFT system to estimate nasalance from an audio signal presents
a promising non-invasive and cost effective tool for clinical monitoring and assessment of VPI in children."

## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify"> Traditional clinical approaches for assessing nasality, such as nasopharyngoscopy and nasometry, involve unpleasant experiences and are problematic for children. Speech
Inversion (SI), a noninvasive technique, offers a promising alternative for estimating articulatory movement without the need
for physical instrumentation. In this study, an SI system trained
on nasalance data from healthy adults is augmented with source
information from electroglottography and acoustically derived
F0, periodic and aperiodic energy estimates as proxies for glottal
control. This model achieves 16.92% relative improvement in
Pearson Product-Moment Correlation (PPMC) compared to a
previous SI system for nasalance estimation. To adapt the SI
system for nasalance estimation in children with Velopharyngeal
Insufficiency (VPI), the model initially trained on adult speech
was fine-tuned using children with VPI data, yielding an 7.90%
relative improvement in PPMC compared to its performance
before fine-tuning.</div>
