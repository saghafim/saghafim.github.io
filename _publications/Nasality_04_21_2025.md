excerpt: "In this paper, a novel SI system was proposed that simultaneously estimates VP TV, along with oral TVs and three source
features. The results demonstrated that the proposed synergistic SI model improves the estimation of VP TV and oral TVs,
underscoring the complementary nature of these characteristics. Additionally, the results highlighted the effectiveness of
the multi-task learning framework and the use of WavLM-Large
self-supervised representations to boost the performance of the
SI system. In particular, the proposed model outperformed other
SI systems that estimate VP TV and oral TVs separately, showcasing the advantages of integrating multiple tasks into a single
model. The proposed system, by estimating multiple speech parameters within a single framework, has clinical potential for
effective monitoring and intervention, particularly for craniofacial disorders."

## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify"> Speech is produced through the coordination of vocal tract
constricting organs: lips, tongue, velum, and glottis. Previous works developed Speech Inversion (SI) systems to recover
acoustic-to-articulatory mappings for lip and tongue constrictions, called oral tract variables (TVs), which were later enhanced by including source information (periodic and aperiodic energies, and F0 frequency) as proxies for glottal control.
Comparison of the nasometric measures with high-speed nasopharyngoscopy showed that nasalance can serve as ground
truth, and that an SI system trained with it reliably recovers velum movement patterns for American English speakers.
Here, two SI training approaches are compared: baseline models that estimate oral TVs and nasalance independently, and a
synergistic model that combines oral TVs and source features
with nasalance. The synergistic model shows relative improvements of 5% in oral TVs estimation and 9% in nasalance estimation compared to the baseline models.</div>
