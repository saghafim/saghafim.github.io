My name is Saba Tabatabaee. I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) and a member of [Speech Communication](https://scl.umd.edu/) group. My research advisor is Prof. [Carol Espy-Wilson](https://isr.umd.edu/clark/faculty/391/Carol-Espy-Wilson).

My research focuses on **speech and audio processing**, with an emphasis on improving the speech inversion system using neural networks and self-supervised speech models under complex and real-world conditions. In parallel, I investigate integrating **speech inversion systems** with **speech enhancement** and **automatic speech recognition** pipelines, aiming to enhance recognition accuracy and speech quality in challenging acoustic conditions. 

Please check list of publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d7tPM7MAAAAJ&hl=en).

**I am currently on the job market and actively seeking internships and full-time opportunities. If my research aligns with your interests, I would be glad to connect.**
