My name is Mohammadreza Saghafi. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/) and a member of [Power and Energy Center]([https://scl.umd.edu/](https://ece.vt.edu/research/centers/energy.html)). My research advisor is Prof. [Lamine Mili](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/mili.html).

My research focuses on **Quantum Computing** and **Power Systems Studies**.
My research focuses on predictive analysis of quantum systems. I work on using mathematical and statistical tools, like time-series forecasting and adaptive filtering, to model and reduce noise in quantum circuits. I’m also interested in observability analysis and optimization methods, especially with gPC expansions, to improve state estimation and system performance. Alongside my quantum computing work, I’ve been exploring power system planning and hybrid energy storage optimization, looking at ways to handle uncertainty and improve efficiency in complex systems.

I also have a strong interest in power system studies, particularly in areas like transmission planning, reliability assessment, and microgrid design. I enjoy looking at how large-scale systems can be planned and operated more efficiently, while also making them more resilient to uncertainties. My work in this space often involves optimization and modeling techniques to evaluate system reliability, study grid integration of renewable resources, and explore how microgrids can support both local communities and larger networks.

**I am currently on the job market and actively seeking full-time opportunities. If my research aligns with your interests, I would be glad to connect.**
