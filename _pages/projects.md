## Dynamic Stability Analysis of a Renewable-Integrated Power Grid (2019)
![EV Charging Infrastructure](/images/Nasa.jpeg){: .align-center}

- Simulated the dynamic behavior of a power grid with high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind/solar).  
- Analyzed grid stability during disturbances such as faults, sudden load changes, or generator tripping.  

---

## Power System Protection (2017)
- Designed and tested protection schemes for different parts of the power system.  
- Ensured that critical equipment was safeguarded during fault conditions.  

---

## Demand Response System – National Power Institute (2018)
- Created a demand response program to help utilities manage peak demand.  
- Incentivized consumers to reduce electricity consumption during peak periods.  

---

## Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure – IKCO (2021)
- Planned and designed an EV charging network.  
- Considered charger placement, power capacity, and grid impact.  

---

## Load Forecasting for Power Grid Optimization Using Machine Learning (2018)
- Applied Random Forests and Gradient Boosting to analyze historical load data and external factors (weather, economy).  
- Integrated forecasts into day-ahead planning with grid operators → reduced operational costs.  
- Presented methodology to stakeholders, demonstrating improved precision in load forecasting.  

---

## Sub-Synchronous Resonance Mitigation in a Power System (2019)
- Investigated SSR risk using the **Heffron-Phillips Model**.  
- Simulated system response in MATLAB with series-compensated transmission lines.  

---

## Robust State Estimation for Power Grids (2023)
- Developed a **robust state estimation model** using Huber loss.  
- Applied **breakdown point analysis** to enhance resilience against bad data.  
- Validated with real-world datasets → higher accuracy than conventional methods.  
- Collaborated with grid operators to improve anomaly detection.
