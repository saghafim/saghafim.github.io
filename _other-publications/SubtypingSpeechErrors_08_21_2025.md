excerpt: "Acoustic-to-articulatory speech inversion, trained on adult ground-truth kinematic data, quantifies clinically interpretable
information about tongue constriction and location for /ɹ/ → /w/, /ɹ/ → vowel, dentalized /s/, and palatalized /s/ speech sound
errors in children and adolescents with speech sound disorders."

## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify"> Speech inversion holds much potential to describe speech errors in childhood speech sound disorders. However, the clinical interpretability of speech inversion tract variables is unknown. This study is the first to show, through linear mixed modeling,
that acoustic-to-articulatory speech inversion can quantify statistically significant articulatory differences between several
perceptually salient subtypes of /ɹ/ and /s/ speech sound errors, and correct /ɹ/ and /s/ targets, in American English..</div>
