excerpt: "This study challenges the traditional view that seizures are solely caused by excessive excitation or reduced inhibition in the brain. Instead, it highlights the paradoxical role of both glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters in seizure generation. By extending an existing thalamocortical model to include spiny stellate (excitatory interneuron) cells, the research demonstrates how these neurons are crucial for generating preictal activityâ€”the transitional state before seizures. Through bifurcation analysis and simulations, the model replicates a wide range of brain dynamics, including normal activity, preictal spikes, absence seizures, clonic seizures, and tonic seizures. The findings reveal that the cooperation between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms, particularly the role of spiny stellate cells and thalamic inputs, governs the transition from normal brain states to seizures. This extended mathematical model provides deeper insights into seizure prediction and may help develop more effective therapeutic strategies."

## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify"> Growing evidence suggests that excitatory neurons in the brain play a significant role in
seizure generation. Nonetheless, spiny stellate cells are cortical excitatory non-pyramidal
neurons in the brain, whose basic role in seizure occurrence is not well understood. In
the present research, we study the critical role of spiny stellate cells or the excitatory
interneurons (EI), for the first time, in epileptic seizure generation using an extended
neural mass model inspired by a thalamocortical model originally introduced by another
research group. Applying bifurcation analysis on this modified model, we investigated
the rich dynamics corresponding to the epileptic seizure onset and transition between
interictal and ictal states caused by EI connectivity to other cell types. Our results
indicate that the transition between interictal and ictal states (preictal signal) corresponds
to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, and thus, the extended model suggests that before
seizure onset, the amplitude and frequency of neural activities gradually increase.
Moreover, we showed that (1) the altered function of GABAergic and glutamatergic
receptors of EI can cause seizure, and (2) the pathway between the thalamic relay
nucleus and EI facilitates the transition from interictal to ictal activity by decreasing
the preictal period. Thereafter, we considered both sensory and cortical periodic inputs
to study model responses to various harmonic stimulations. Bifurcation analysis of the
model, in this case, suggests that the initial state of the model might be the main cause
for the transition between interictal and ictal states as the stimulus frequency changes.
The extended thalamocortical model shows also that the amplitude jump phenomenon
and non-linear resonance behavior result from the preictal state of the modified model.
These results can be considered as a step forward to a deeper understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the transition from normal activities to epileptic activities.</div>
